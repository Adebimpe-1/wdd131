            <h2>About Lagos, Nigeria</h2>
            <p>Lagos, Nigeria is a major metropolitan city located in the southwestern part of Nigeria along the coast of the Gulf of
            Guinea, near the border with Benin. It is the largest city in Nigeria and the most populous urban area in Africa, with
            over 21 million inhabitants as of recent estimates. Lagos stands out as a vibrant economic hub, known for its bustling
            seaport, thriving commerce, finance, entertainment, technology, and cultural scene. The city’s dynamic energy and rapid
            growth make it one of the fastest-growing megacities globally. Lagos’s significance lies in its role as a vital
            financial center for Nigeria and Africa overall, as well as a cultural and commercial hotspot that shapes the
            continent’s art, fashion, politics, and tourism landscape.</p>
